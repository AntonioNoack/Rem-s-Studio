# Rem's-Studio

This studio is intended for starters in the Video industry, or YouTubers,
and was inspired by the channel [YDS](https://www.youtube.com/user/YutsuraidanceStudios). I wanted to be able to make those transitions and motions easily myself. Without needing to buy some expensive software.

That's why Rem's Studio will always be sold **low-priced** to individuals, and may stay free, if you build it yourself (proof of work, that you really can't afford it ;)).
In the alpha times, you all are early testers, so you get it for **free** anyways <3 :D.
