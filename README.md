# Rem's Studio <!-- 's is correct, because it's owned; I thought it may be only for abbreviations of is -->

This studio is intended for starters in the video industry, or YouTubers,
and was inspired by the channel [YDS](https://www.youtube.com/user/YutsuraidanceStudios). I wanted to be able to make those transitions and motions easily myself. Without needing to buy some expensive software.

That's why Rem's Studio will always be sold **low-priced** to individuals, and may stay free, if you build it yourself (proof of work, that you really can't afford it ;)).
In the alpha times, you all are early testers, so you get it for **free** anyways <3 :D.


The name is from Rem, an Anime character, I like; inspired by YDS, too, because they use the Anime/Manga style. If you have issues with that, you can imagine it's named after Rembrandt.

The project is developed with Kotlin,JVM, so plugins should be possible, and are a goal at some point.
It is additionally developed with Java, so it works with Windows and Linux.

## Currently used libraries

* LWJGL (OpenGL + GLFW + OpenAL + Slick)
* JOML (Matrix calculations and transforms for rendering)
* FFMpeg (Video/Image/Audio Import & Export)
* HSLuv (HSL alternative with constant brightness)
* OpenSimplexNoise (Noise Generator)
* Apache Imaging (More supported image formats, like .ico)

## Download

I will provide a download, when the alpha stage is reached (basic features working, automatic setup).
